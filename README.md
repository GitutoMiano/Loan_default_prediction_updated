### Overview

Financial institutions struggle with assessing loan applicants' creditworthiness, impacting their ability to manage risk and minimize defaults. Traditional credit evaluation methods may not capture the complexities of financial behaviour, leading to potential losses. Leveraging machine learning can enhance loan approval processes and decision-making.

### Challenge

Develop a predictive model to assess loan default risk based on applicant data. The goal is to help financial institutions improve lending decisions, reduce defaults, and enhance portfolio performance.

### Objectives

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:
   - Analyse the dataset to identify key features affecting loan default.
   - Clean and preprocess data for modelling.

2. **Model Development**:
   - Build and train a predictive model using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machines.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Assess model performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Ensure fairness and address biases, especially regarding income and employment.

4. **Actionable Insights**:
   - Identify factors impacting loan default risk.
   - Recommend how to integrate the model into loan approval processes.

5. **Documentation and Presentation**:
   - Document the process, model selection, and evaluation.
   - Prepare a presentation to communicate the model's performance and insights.

### Submission Requirements

- Well-documented code repository with run instructions.
- Detailed report or presentation summarizing approach, results, and insights.
- Demo or visualisation of model predictions and their impact.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Model accuracy and performance.
- Quality of data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Fairness and bias in predictions.
- Clarity and usefulness of insights.
- Overall presentation and documentation.

### Dataset

- Kaggle: [Loan Default Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/loan-default-dataset)
